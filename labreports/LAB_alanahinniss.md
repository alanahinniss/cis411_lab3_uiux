# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Indeed | 21/21 | Indeed is a well-known job search site which I really like. I already have an account and the reason I use this site it because its purpose and instructions are clear and known - which allows users to navigate throuhg the site quickly. It is vivid that Indeed values the users time by being very concise and straight to the point. This site is also friendly for all users; this was shown but the accessiblity which allowed disabled people to use the site readily.|
| Snagajob | 10/21 | I am not a fan of Snagajob. This is my first time creating an account and using this site. I did not enjoy how long it took to create a basic profile. Another negative aspect I did not enjoy was how limited some of the job search options were. |

## 2.2 Site 1
+ I already had an Indeed profile, see below for my login process:
  
![signin](/labreports/signin.png)

+ The image attached, is where I signin info to log in. This is a straight-forward process.
  
![homepage](/labreports/homepage.png)

+ The homepage is user-friendly. There is a serach tab making it easier to navigate through. The user is also recommended jobs based on their suggested searches.
  
![profile](/labreports/profile.png)

+ This feature allows users to update qualities about theirself: such as their experience, skill, interest in jobs, etc.
+ 
![savedjobs](/labreports/searchjobs.png)

+ Based on what the user is looking for in a occupation, they are able to save the job as well as keep track on the process. For example if they applied, got hired, not accepted, etc.

## 2.3 Site 2
![homepage - snagajob](/labreports/homepage%20-%20snagajob.png)

+ This is the homepage for SnagAJob. The quick search otion, is a feature I like. However, when it is time for a user to create a profile, it is confused as to which option they should click.
